# MashupMaker
Software to make only the best of audio mashups (aka randomly create mashups)

This incredibly complex algorithm uses a random number generator to create random mashups of songs. If it isn't clear, this took 30 minutes. Don't judge. 

To run, download pydub http://pydub.com/ by running `pip install pydub`
